        "# What To Watch Next Weekend?\n",
        "Do you want a list of movies  for the next coming holiday? We have programmed a simple recommender system in Python based on *Matrix Factorization* collaborative filtering  which can recommend you a list of movies that you might really like to watch. Give it a try.  Find the movies that you have watched in this [list](https://github.com/saminehbagheri/Recommender-System/blob/master/movie_ids.txt) and rate them as I have done in the the cell bellow in the myratings dataframe. Our list contains 1682 movies produced in 1930 till 1998 (pretty old but I might say there are many good movies among them). Once you are done with ratings just pass them in form of a dataframe in the $\\color{blue}{\\text{weRecommend()}}$ function and wait about a minute or two. This function will return you two lists. Best and worst movies for you to watch."
