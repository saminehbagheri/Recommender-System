        "# What To Watch Next Weekend?\n",
        "Do you want a list of movies  for the next coming holiday? We have programmed a simple recommender system in Python based on *Matrix Factorization* collaborative filtering  which can recommend  you a list of movies that you might really like to watch. Give it a try.  Find the movies that you have watched in this [list](https://github.com/saminehbagheri/Recommender-System/blob/master/movie_ids.txt) and rate them as I have done in the the cell bellow in the myratings dataframe. Ratings should be numbers from 5 (best) to 1 (worst). Our list contains 1682 movies produced from 1930 till 1998 (pretty old but I might say there are many good movies among them). Once you are done with the ratings just pass them in form of a dataframe to the $\\color{blue}{\\text{weRecommend()}}$ function and wait about a minute or two. This function will return to you with two lists: Best and worst movies for you to watch.\n",

As you can see I have rated three of the Star Trek movies with 5 and three documentary or drama movies with 1 (These ratings are only done for illustrative purposes and do not reflect my interests at all). The recommender system suggests me watching the other Star Trek movies which seems to be a reasonable choice for a Star Trek fan. Please note that this is only achieved by Matrix Factorization and our system does not have any prior knowldge about the genre of the  movies or their names. You can find a detailed article about this algorithm and a step-by-step implementaion of it in this [Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Q68oZBb35VcqYlLiVPO976d6kCvEO1Xt#scrollTo=CRTpRrzoCBtT).
